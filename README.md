# Homework-03

Week 3 homework for my bootcamp. For this project, I am tasked in creating an application that generates a password based on user-selected criteria.

The user is able to select whether or not the password will include lowercase, uppercase letters, numbers, and or special characters.

The user may also adjust a slider to determine the length of the password generated, from 8 characters to 128 characters.

A button is also presented along with the generated password to conveniently copy it to their clipboard.
