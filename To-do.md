<!-- - Create button -->

- Give button functionality to generate password
  <!-- - Pressing button prompts users of different password criteria -->
    <!-- Either using radio buttons or square selectors to specifiy different criteria -->
  <!-- - Determine how many different criteria can be altered by user -->
    <!-- lowercase -->
    <!-- uppercase -->
    <!-- numeric -->
    <!-- special characters -->
  <!-- - Password should be >= 8 <= 128 characters in length -->

- Must be responsive
- Make password length slider span the length of the card-body

Current goals as of 5/28
We have variables that contain all necessary characters
We have logic that changes password generation based on what boxes the user has selected

<!-- Find a way to communicate the password length selected by user to javascript -->
<!-- Make the Button actually generate a password -->

Generate password on screen besides the console
Allow length to be affected
